This is a Hello World post. I figured I needed to start a blog a few years ago. I was lazy, so I didn't do it.
Last year I began using "GitHub":http://github.com/ and really liked it. A couple of days ago I heard of "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/, and thought it'd be a great fit for my hacky way of doing things. I didn't want to think about hosting my own Wordpress blog.

I hope you'll be 'reading' from me in the near future.
